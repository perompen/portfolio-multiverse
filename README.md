Portfolio Introduction
I am a Software Engineer Apprentice based in Seattle, WA. Through Multiverse and American Express I was able learn from a bootcamp as well as gain hands-on experience from the cultural tech world. By applying these soft and technical skills I have been able to build personal and professional projects. Getting the chance to collaborate with cohort and team memebers has overall added to my growth and experience!
